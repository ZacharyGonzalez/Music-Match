Collect data from spotify. Preferably top songs per month, each year, or similar associated data (especially if it can come in a ~by US State~ way)
    store the data in a database/drive so we dont have to retrieve it again/ can aggregate each request.

Collect data of unemployment per month, each year, or similarly associated social parameters for the USA, or maybe even globally/ for other countries
    store the data in a database/drive so we dont have to retrieve it again/ can aggregate each request.

Create an API for the spotify section, we want to be able to query the dataset and also be able to create and use smaller subsets of the data. so a transaction can be a list of queries, with the returned data being the table/data.
create an API for the unemployment section, we want to be able to query in a similar manner.

Create a controller that will be passing the queries to both API's. The purpose of all of this is to have a front facing UI that can select predefined queries:
    those quries will be complicated and constructed on the backend, but it will attain the required information to provide the information to the UI.

    For example, if we can get location data, we can chose to select popular monthly music genre, generate a heatmap for that, then gen a heatmap for unemployment and compare if music has any correlation.
    and it should be able to provide a month by month graphic to show how things change, if possible it would be cool to have the heatmaps flow between the two states as a transition.


The end product should be a UI displaying a map, that map will represent the data and how it changes over time, based on a selected query.
