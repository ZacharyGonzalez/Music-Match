# Music-Match (WIP)


Generation of top songs played by location with the ability to compare to other types of heatmap overlays (unemployment records from .gov for example).

This data can be interesting, if we can determine a correlation between to societal events, such as more 'dark pop' being listened to as earthquakes become frequent, then recommendations and other services can be optimized.

In essence, this project looks to find a metric to measure a geographical locations societal "mood" or mindset.
